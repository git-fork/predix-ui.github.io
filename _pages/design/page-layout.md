# Best Practices
### Efficient use of real estate
Strive for an edge-to-edge layout that takes advantage of screen real estate.

### Adhere to a layout grid
Choose a consistent layout grid to use across your product's pages. Consider the horizontal and vertical alignment of page components and content to aid in predictability and scan-ability.

### Use negative space to cluster information
Predix app pages are clean and easy to scan. Use negative space or light weight rules to cluster information. Px-layout has padding built into it's cells for this purpose.

### Establish a family
Structural consistency is critical in creating efficiency in a workflow. Choose layouts that are predicable and expected when designing your product.



# Basic Structure
The basic components of a page include an optional branding area, navigation, cards to group similar content, and an optional footer. Navigation may live on the left side or the top of the page structure.

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/horizontal_layout"
    img-alt="horizontal layout"
    title="Page assembly with horizontal navigation">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/vertical_layout"
    img-alt="vertical layout"
    title="Page assembly with vertical navigation">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>


# Base Screen Sizes
|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| Desktop | 1280x960 |
| Tablet  | 1024x768 |
| Mobile  | 320x568  |

# Layout Grid
The layout grid is a 12 column, 15px grid supporting horizontal and vertical navigation as well as the inbox layout. Grids are available in the Design Starter Kit.

There are several CSS modules in the design system that can be used to create a page layout:

* [px-layout-design](#/css/px-layout-design): Defines the 'grid' for Predix UI. Layout items can be autosized or given a specific width, and layouts reflow responsively on smaller viewports.

* [px-spacing](#/css/px-spacing-design): A collection of helper classes for spacing such as margin and padding.


* [px-flexbox-design](#/css/px-flexbox-design): Creates layout classes to give elements sizes and dynamically put elements in the right place. The flexbox module is a wrapper around all of CSS flexbox's non-unit-based properties.

* [px-widths-responsive-design](#/css/px-widths-design): Provides breakpoint-based classes for widths on elements.


# Grid Variations
There are five variations of the grid to supporting a one to six column layout, allowing a designer to choose a layout that matches the information to display.

### Six Column Grid
For information-dense screens and workflows such as cases, or asset records.

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/six_column_grid"
    img-alt="six column grid">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/6_column_example"
    img-alt="6 column example">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>


### Three & Four Column Grids
Commonly used for dashboards or layouts with large widgets displaying high level information.

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/three_column_grid"
    img-alt="three column grid">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/three_column_example"
    img-alt="three column example">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/four_column_grid"
    img-alt="four column grid">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/4_column_example"
    img-alt="four column example">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>


### Single Column
Commonly used for dashboards or layouts with large widgets displaying high level information.

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/single_column_grid"
    img-alt="single column grid">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/single_column_example"
    img-alt="single column example">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>

### Combine column layouts to create variations that best fit your data:
<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/combined_grid"
    img-alt="combined grid">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/multi_column_example"
    img-alt="multi column example">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>


# Cards
Cards are used to group similar information into logical groups to make it easier for people to consume. They consist of a header area and content area, with spacing in between. The header can optionally contain a descriptive icon in the top left corner and/or a chevron button in the top right corner for configuration options or other menu items. The [px-card](#/components/px-card) component provides this functionality.

Information in cards can be clustered based on the grid layout of your choice.

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/card_1up"
    img-alt="1 up card">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/card_2up"
    img-alt="2 up card">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/card_3up"
    img-alt="3 up card">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/card_example"
    img-alt="card example">
  </catalog-picture>
  <catalog-picture
    class="layout__item picture-side-by-side"
    img-src="../../../img/guidelines/card_example_redline"
    img-alt="card example redline">
  </catalog-picture>
</div>
