Effective writing provides relevant information for appropriate users.  You can provide more useful UI designs by making sure your descriptive copy is clear, accurate, and helpful. See the below copy best practices and a table with specific examples for your design components.

# Copy Best Practices
### Be clear

Lead with your main point, and avoid vague references. Write concise, direct sentences and focus on one idea at a time. Compact sentences are always welcome: try reducing as many padded words as possible and still retain your meaning. Within paragraphs, you can vary sentence lengths as needed to distinguish one concept from another (but don’t mix unrelated topics or write run-on sentences of 25 or more words).

Avoid undue alarm and explain issues succinctly with clear solutions. You can also do the user a favor by suggesting options for “learning by doing,” including extra how-tos, hands-on steps, and use-case examples. Simple directions work best, so avoid over-statements or unsupported generalities; instead, cite specific features with your advice. Be succinct and don't overly explain—highly detailed descriptions can raise additional, complicating questions for a user.


### Be accurate

Following writing rules (see the table below) can help you describe design tools and concepts more accurately. For example, apply standard punctuation guidelines to avoid user misinterpretation. Also be careful not to confuse past, present, and future tenses among sentences.

Remember to avoid sentence fragments (phrases lacking a subject and/or verb) that are message dead-ends. Don’t mix “person” usage, where switching back and forth between “we” and “you” references makes the subject unclear. Word choice matters greatly, too; always check definitions when you’re not sure what word is correct. And limit your use of technical slang, terminology, abbreviations, or acronyms that may not be commonly known.


### Be helpful

Whether you're writing for a web page, tutorial, blog, white paper, documentation, or other form of content, your communication should be straightforward, connected, and authentic. This means your tone should remain positive in attitude (purposeful not pushy), relationship (friendly not formal), and emotion (real not robotic).

Establish why the user needs to follow your guide, and note any prerequisites or set-up needs. Try for an upbeat and active voice (hint: lead many of your sentences with a verb). Always remember you are in conversation with peers, so avoid biased language and insincere clichés. Also don’t assume a user’s expertise or skip information, but carefully guide the user through logical steps and practices (users may be following your instructions for the first time).
