# FAQ

### Q: Why release a new aesthetic to the Predix Design System?
A: The previous Predix Design System was over 2 years old. Based on learnings and feedback from our users, we were excited to collaborate with our community to release a more contemporary and sophisticated visual style.

### Q: I’m using a pre-Cirrus Predix UI component, can I still use this version and make a fix or enhancement to it myself?
A: Yes you can but you should also make the fix/enhancement in the Cirrus version of the component.

### Q: I need the Predix UI team to make an enhancement to a component or chart. Can you do this on the pre-Cirrus component?
A: No. We are maintaining and enhancing only the Cirrus version of the components going forward. Please contact the Predix UI team if there is an urgent business case for your request.

### Q: Can I take one of the Cirrus components or charts without upgrading all of my components?
A: No. There are dependencies between components, so this is not recommended. You should upgrade your app to be in sync and have a harmonious user experience.

### Q: I have other non-Predix UI components mixed in with Predix UI components in my application, how do I apply Cirrus to these?
A: There are Design Guidelines to help your designers to redesign these components and Predix UI designers have internal office hours to support.

### Q: I have a need for a design that is not part of the Predix Design System? How can I get this included?
A: We love contributions back to the Predix Design System. Please contact the Predix UI team to discuss the proposed contribution.
