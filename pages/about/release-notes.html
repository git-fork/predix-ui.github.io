<h4 class="u-mt+ u-pt+">FAQ</h4>
<p><b>Q: Why release a Refresh to the Predix Design System?</b><br/>
A: The previous Predix Design System was over 2 years old. Based on learnings and feedback from our users, we were excited to collaborate with our community to release a more contemporary and sophisticated visual style.</p>

<p class="u-mt+ u-pt+"><b>Q: I’m using a pre-Refresh Predix UI component, can I still use this version and make a fix or enhancement to it myself?</b><br/>
A: Yes you can but you should also make the fix/enhancement in the Design Refresh version of the component.</p>

<p class="u-mt+ u-pt+"><b>Q: I need the Predix UI team to make an enhancement to a component or chart. Can you do this on the pre-Refresh component?</b><br/>
A: No. We are maintaining and enhancing only the Design Refresh version of the components going forward. Please contact the Predix UI team if there is an urgent business case for your request.</p>

<p class="u-mt+ u-pt+"><b>Q: Can I take one of the Design Refresh components or charts without upgrading all of my components?</b><br/>
A: No –there are dependencies between components, so this is not recommended. You should upgrade your app to be in sync and have a harmonious user experience.</p>


<p class="u-mt+ u-pt+"><b>Q: I have other non-Predix UI components mixed in with Predix UI components in my application, how do I apply Refresh to these?</b><br/>
A: There are Design Guidelines to help your designers to redesign these components and Predix UI designers have internal office hours to support.</p>

<p class="u-mt+ u-pt+"><b>Q: I have a need for a design that is not part of the Predix Design System? How can I get this included?</b><br/>
A: We love contributions back to the Predix Design System. Please contact the Predix UI team to discuss the proposed contribution.</p>
